# How to read locator settings.
Every project setting is available in the scripting environment through the global variable **project**.  
You can seriously destroy a project by making changes to the **project** object. Make any changes here at your own risk. Don't expect sympathetic support from Tech Support if you ruin your project this way :-).

# Reading Locator Settings.
Let's say you want access to the **Mininum confidence** of the Database Locator.

1. Open the script window and press **Play**.
1. Put **project.** into the Watch window.

1. You want to look at locator **DB** in class **Document**. Drill down into the locator definition  **project.classbyName("Document").Locators.ItemByName("DB").LocatorMethod**

1. This shows  that the Database Locator is of Type **CSCDatabaseLocator** (ignore the **I** for interface). This will give us access to all settings in the locator.
1. Open Menu **Edit/References..** in the Script Editor.
1. Find the Database Locator under **Kofax Cascade**, select it and press OK.

2. Add the following script wherever you need it.
    ```vb
    Dim DBLocDef As CscDatabaseLocator
    Set DBLocDef = Project.ClassByName("Document").Locators.ItemByName("DB").LocatorMethod
    DBLocDef.
    ```
2. You can now see the attributes of the locator and use them in your script.  
*You can change locators, but you risk destroying your project. Be warned!!*
