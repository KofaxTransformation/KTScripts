# Kofax Transformation Script Library
A collection of mostly very useful scripts containing various algorithms.  
These scripts are provided as-is. There is no guarantee that they will work. You will need to understand them to use them in your projects.  
Requests, fixes, suggestions, and new scripts are welcome. Please use [issues](https://github.com/KofaxRPA/KTScripts/issues) to provide feedback.
