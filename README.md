# Kofax Transformation Script Library
A collection of very useful scripts containing various algorithms.  
These scripts are provided as-is. There is no guarantee that they will work. You will need to understand them to use them in your projects.  
Please use [issues](https://github.com/KofaxRPA/KTScripts/issues) for requests, fixes, suggestions, and new scripts you want to share.

# Project Manipulation
These are advanced scripting techniques to access to project and locator settings via script. This gives you the power to create, delete and edit classses, fields, locators, and almost any setting in the project. This is very dangerous and can destroy your projects. Also note that the Project Builder will not be updated with changes you make to the project and will cause GUI errors. Tread carefully and  - you are on your own - don't expect support from Tech Support!
