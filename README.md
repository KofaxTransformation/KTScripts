# Kofax Transformation Script Library
A collection of mostly very useful scripts containing various algorithms.  
These scripts are provided as-is. There is no guarantee that they will work. You will need to understand them to use them in your projects.  
Requests, fixes, suggestions, and new scripts are welcome. Please use [issues](https://github.com/KofaxRPA/KTScripts/issues) to provide feedback.
# Script Locators
* [Column Locator](Column%20Locator.md) *detects text columns in a document*
* [Dynamic Fuzzy Search Locator](DynamicFuzzySearchLocator.md) **POWERFUL** *fuzzy search a document for values from a previous locator!*
