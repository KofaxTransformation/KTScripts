# Language Classification Robot
This robot downloads 1000 random Wikipedia pages per language for training in KT Classification. It also downloads 1000 pages per language for testing.  
This project provides extraordinarily precise langauge detection, even on phrases as small as two or three words. It is very precise at distinguishing similar languages like Persian And Arabic or Bulgarian, Ukrainian and Russian or Nordic Languages.
