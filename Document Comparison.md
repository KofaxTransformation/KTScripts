# Document Comparison

This script compares a document with another document and shows all differences in a table list, where they can be accepted or rejected.  This supports documents of any length and efficiently finds all the differences.  
The results are shown in a table. You can see the deletions are shown with *-DEL-* and insertions with *-INS-*.
The new document is marked as valid and the original is read-only. The user only has to confirm a result by pressing ENTER and rejecting by pressing SPACE and ENTER.

This simple example is only showing mistmatches. You can adjust to show more word context for each documen, but if you click or tab onto the Document Text, then the document image will scroll to show the document.  
The script is fast and will find the optimal match - if the documents are very similar the match is even faster.  
If you want to see both documents, you will have to merge the images of the original documents together, or launch it with an external program...

# Configuration
* Add the script below to the document class you want to compare or to any higher class.
* In the Script editor add a refence to **Microsoft Scripting Runtime** in the Menu **Edit/References..**
* Create a Table Model with 3 columns **Document**, **OK** and **Original**  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47416964/90763048-51be4180-e2e6-11ea-9896-3d1ae87ca7f0.png)
* Add a Table Locator to the class called "TL_Diffs". The name is checked in the Sub *Document_AfterLocate* below, which customizes the table locator.
* You will need a method to find the reference document that you want to compare with. The script below just uses the first Extraction Training Sample from the class. 
#  Design your Validation Form
* Make column 2 very narrow and set as a checkbox.
* Make column 3 read only.
# How it works
The algorithm finds all the unique words in each document, and then finds the largest match of unique words between the two documents. This breaks the document into smaller documents - this is done successively until unique word matches are found. The remaining document fragments are then aligned using backtracking of the [Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).
