# Save Fields as TIFF
This is useful to save individual fields from many tiff documents as their own files. This helps to anonymize data, and randomizes the file names.  
Steps.
* Create Truth files by extracting and validating your Xdocs and saving them with the blue floppy disk icon ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47416964/171147412-18617786-ef2f-414a-8c01-3d0b3a87a3d8.png)
in the **Documents** window.
* Paste the following code into your Document Class
```vb
```
* Change the **Case** Statement to select all of the fields that you would like to save as TIFF.
* Change the **Path** to the location where you want the images saved.
* Create the **Path** in Windows Explorer. The script doesn't create the folder.
