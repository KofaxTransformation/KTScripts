# How to make a multiline Locator. 
In the following document we have a multiline PO Number. Neither the Format locator, nor any of the Group Locators (Order Group Locator, Trainable Group Locator, ...) will find the entire value, since most locators stay within a single textline.  
![Alt text](images/PONumber.png)  

## Solution Idea 
We know that the PO Number should be 16 characters long. We can test if including the word(s) directly below what the locator found is closer to 16 characters. "36800-000000" is 12 characters and has error=4, but "36800-0000009744" is 16 characters long with an error=0 and so is the better option.

## Analysis
If we open the XDoc in the XDocBrowser we can inspect the OCR Text Lines within the first **Representation**.

![Alt text](images/XDocBrowserTextLines.png)

We see that the PO Number is 3 words (**368000, -, 000000**) in line 1 and that **9744** is word 1 in textline 2.  
In the OCR Settings, "-" is considered a word separation character, that is why the PO Number is 3 words long!

We will write a script that looks inside the green rectangle below, calculating carefully the **top, left, width and height** of the green rectangle. 
![Alt text](images/greenrectangle.png)  
We have to be careful here because TextLine 1 and TextLine 2 overlap due to the misalignment of the PO Number column bacause of  central vertical cell alignment and  word wrapping.



# Script 
We will assume that the PO Number is found by either Order Group Locator, Trainable Group Locator, or is in an Advanced Evaluator. If you use a Format Locator to find it, then you should flow that into an Advanced Evaluator. Each of these locators contains the **OrderNumber** as a **SubField** and not an **Alternative**.  
The script below does the following.
* customizes the **OrderNumber** locator.
* Finds which OCR words were used in the subfield by calling the wonderful function **pXDoc.GetWordsInRectangle()** using the subfield's own coordinates. This will give us the three words "36800", "-", "000000" and all of their coordinates and importantly, their Text Line Index.
* Calculate the green rectangle by considering the **next** TextLine.  
![Alt text](images/greenrectangle.png) 
* Run a Field Formatter on the Text. The OCR result is "36800 - 0000009744" but we need "36800-0000009744" because we want to measure the length of the value. We will use a Field Formatter called **RemoveSpaces** to do that. *See second script below for an example.*
* Calculate if the subfield text is closer to 16 in length than the subfield text +green box text is. If the green box is "better" then **append** the green box words to the subfield. **Appending** words to a subfield or field expands the bounding box automatically so that the subfield highlighting shows correctly on the document in green.

* You can now simply click **Test** on the locator and see the result.

### Class level script
Put this script into the class containing your OrderNumber locator
```vb
