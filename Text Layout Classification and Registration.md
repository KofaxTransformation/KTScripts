# Text Layout Algorithm (called "TL" below)
TL uses the location of almost every word on the page to either *classify the page* or *register OCR zones*.
Every unique word on the page is *aligned* to it's corresponding word on the other document. This gives the precise vertical shift and stretch, and horizontal shift and stretch. TL is VERY robust against OCR errors because even if 60% of the words had OCR errors, we would still find the correct alignment with the remaining 40% easily.  

TL allows subpixel accuracy in **registering** OCR zones because we have used 100s of words on the page to do the registration.
TL  allows **very precise classification** because if the documents are only slightly different then words don't have the same alignment with each other. This can easily detect when an extra line of text has been added to the middle of a document

TL takes about 1 second for the comparison between the document and the training sample in the project class.  

Place this code into the Project level script. Add a reference to Microsoft Scripting Runtime.

## Text Layout Classification
TL is very useful when
*  2 document classes differ only by a few words. Maybe an extra sentence or 1 less sentence.

 If you use it to compare with 10 documents, then it would take 10 seconds. It is best to classify documents with the in-built fast "Layout Classification" and "Text Classification", and then do sub-classification with the variants of a class.  
Here is a Classification Benchmark for a set of Japanese Forms that are almost identical with each other - they vary only in a few words and phrases.

 ### Example.
 Your project has document classes **A**, **B** and **C**, which are quite different from each other. Document **B** has variants **B1** to **B6** that are quite similiar to each other and are subclasses of **B** because although they have the same fields, some or all of the locators need to be different.    
 After a document is either classified as **B** or **B1** to **B6**, TL tests the document with all 7 classes with the *Text Layout* algorithm and assigns the document to the class with the best match.

## Text Layout Registration
This algorithm is very useful when you need to perform OCR on a document and the document 
* has MANY background words on the page, as is typical on a US government or insurance form
* is highly stretched in one direction. 
* has a strong zoom (e.g. a photo from a mobile phone with the camera far back) 
* came from a mobile phone and the camera was at an angle to the paper.
* has zones shifted more than 10mm.

TL uses every unique word on the page as an anchor. This is much better than manually configuring a few anchors yourself.  

**NOTICE** Please test the Advanced Zone Locator** with the following registration settings *before* you try this algorithm.
Usually these settings mean you do not need to use my custom algorithm.
1. Make sure Registration Type is **custom**
1. Disable **Anchors** (don't use anchors as they are lots of work and don't do as good a job 
1. Enable **Lines** if your document has many vertical and horizontal lines on it
1. Enable **OCR** if your document has a lot of background text (which is what Layout Classification uses as well!)
1. Enable **Layout**
1. Enable **Account for Local Distortion**.   (TL checks for distortion across the whole page)
1. Set **Local re-registration** to max of 10 mm horizontally and vertically. (my algorithm has unlimited re-registration distance)
1. Disable **Registration Failure makes zone invalid** as you want to see where the zones would be found.

Kofax Transformation has support for adjusting the zones of a Zone Locator by script - we will use this technique here as well.
## How TL Works
TL uses the following algorithm
1. Find all unique words on Document A (This is the document you want to classify or register) using a Dictionary object. This is very fast.
2. Find all unique words on Document B (This is either the classification sample document or Zone Locator's sample document)
3. Find all unique words on Document A that are on Document B. These are the anchor words we will use to align the documents.
4. Plot the X coordinate of each word in Document A against the X coordinate of each word in Document B and calculate the line passing through them using [linear regression](https://www.easycalculation.com/statistics/learn-regression.php), a High School math technique.

5. Linear Regression calculates 
* the **slope**, M, of the line, which corresponds to the **stretch**. In the example you see that the document has 97.8% of the width of the original document and 96.0% of the height.
* the **intercept**, B, of the line, which corresponds to the **shift**. In the example you see that the document has shifted 118.2 pixels horizontally and 65.3 pixels vertically
* the **R**, R, of the line, shows how well the dots fit on a straight line. 1.000 is perfect alignment. In this case we have perfect alignment horizontally and vertically.
