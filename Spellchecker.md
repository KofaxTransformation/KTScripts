# Spellchecker  
This script uses a fuzzy database to spellcheck a string. To use it simply make a Locator called SL_Spellcheck 
and make it a Script Locator. Then paste the code below into the script field.  Make sure that your database is of type "Associative Search"
```vba
Private Sub SL_Spellcheck_LocateAlternatives(ByVal pXDoc As CASCADELib.CscXDocument, ByVal pLocator As CASCADELib.CscXDocField)
   Dim Test As String, Results As CscXDocFieldAlternatives, NumWords As Long, R As Long, T As Long, Word As String, Words() As String
   Dim ResultWords() As String, H As Long, NewWords() As String
   Test = ""
   Test = Trim(UCase(Test))
   'Test = Replace(Test, "ยง", "ล")
   'Set Results = Database_FuzzySearch("Turkish_banks", "WORD", Test, 100, 0.01)
   Set Results = Project.Databases.ItemByName("Turkish_banks_asd").AssociativeSearch.SearchText(Test, 100).Alternatives
   NumWords = UBound(Split(Test))
   ReDim Words(NumWords) As String
   ReDim NewWords(NumWords) As String
   Words = Split(Test)
   For R=0 To Results.Count-1
      ReDim ResultWords(UBound(Split(Results(R).Text)))
      ResultWords = Split(Results(R).Text)
      NumWords = UBound(Split(Results(R).Text))
      For T=0 To UBound(Words)-NumWords
         For H=0 To NumWords
            If String_LevenshteinDistance(ResultWords(H), Words(T+H)) > Len(ResultWords(H))\3 Then 'The words don't match up
               Exit For
            End If
            If H=NumWords Then 'The entire phrase is compatible
               For H=0 To NumWords
                  If NewWords(T+H)="" Then
                     NewWords(T+H) = ResultWords(H)
                  Else
                     Exit For
                  End If
               Next
               Exit For
            End If
         Next
      Next
   Next
   For R=0 To UBound(NewWords)
      If NewWords(R)="" Then
         NewWords(R)=Words(R)
      End If
   Next
   Test=Join(NewWords, " ")
   pLocator.Alternatives.Create.Text=Test
End Sub
